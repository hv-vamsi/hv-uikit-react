# Virtualized Infinite Loading Table

This sample showcases a table that loads data from the server in chunks as the user scrolls down, using the `useSWRInfinite` hook from `swr`.

It uses `@tanstack/react-virtual` to render only the visible rows, which makes it possible to handle large datasets with less performance issues.

Pagination, sorting, and filtering are all handled server-side. The server-side behavior is mocked using an Arquero table.
